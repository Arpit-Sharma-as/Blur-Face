# Blur-Face
Real-Time Face Blurring with OpenCV
Overview
Welcome to the Real-Time Face Blurring project! This repository contains Python code that demonstrates how to use the OpenCV library to detect faces in a live webcam stream and apply a Gaussian blur to anonymize them in real-time.

Features
Face Detection: Utilizes a pre-trained Haar Cascade classifier to detect faces in each frame of the webcam stream.
Gaussian Blur: Applies a Gaussian blur to the detected face region, ensuring privacy.
Live Stream: Displays the processed live stream with blurred faces.
Requirements
Python 3.x
OpenCV library
Usage
Clone the repository:


##
git clone [your github repo link]
cd BlurredFaces
##

Install the required libraries:

##
pip install opencv-python
##

Run the script:

##
python blur_faces.py
##

Press the ENTER key to exit the live stream.

Customize
Feel free to customize the code or integrate it into your projects. You can adjust parameters, experiment with different face detection algorithms, or incorporate the functionality into other applications.
